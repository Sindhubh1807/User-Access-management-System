Description
The User Access Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of managing user access to various software applications within an organization. It provides role-based access control, allowing different levels of users (Employees, Managers, Admins) to perform specific actions like requesting access to software, approving/rejecting requests, and managing software applications.

This system ensures secure management of user access and simplifies the approval workflows for access control. The project is built using Java Servlets, JSP (JavaServer Pages), and a PostgreSQL database, with Apache Tomcat serving as the web server.
Features
User Registration:

Users can sign up for an account with a default role of Employee.
Role-based login with Employee, Manager, and Admin permissions.
Role-Based Access Control:

Employees can request access to software.
Managers can approve or reject access requests.
Admins can manage software and perform all actions available to other roles.
Software Management (Admin):

Admins can create and manage software applications with different access levels (Read, Write, Admin).
Access Request Submission:

Employees can request access to software and specify the desired access level and reason.
Request Approval:

Managers can review and approve or reject requests made by employees.
PostgreSQL Integration:

Data for users, software applications, and access requests is stored securely in a PostgreSQL database.
Security:

Passwords are stored securely, and role-based permissions prevent unauthorized actions.
Installation
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) (v8 or later)
Apache Tomcat (v9.0 or later)
PostgreSQL (v12 or later)
Maven (for dependency management)
Eclipse IDE or IntelliJ IDEA (or any Java-compatible IDE)
Setup Steps
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/user-access-management.git
cd user-access-management
Database Setup:

Install PostgreSQL from PostgreSQL Downloads.
Open pgAdmin and create a new database:
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE user_access_management;

Import the Project in Eclipse:

Open Eclipse and go to File > Import > Maven > Existing Maven Projects.
Browse to the directory where the project is located and click Finish.
Add PostgreSQL Dependency:

In the pom.xml file, add the PostgreSQL JDBC driver:
xml

Configure Tomcat in Eclipse:

Open the Servers tab, right-click, and choose New > Server.
Select Apache Tomcat v9.0 and configure it to run your project.
Database Connection:

Create a DatabaseConnection.java file to handle database connections:
java

Right-click on your project and choose Run As > Run on Server to deploy the project on Tomcat.
Usage
1. Register as a New User:
Navigate to the Sign-Up Page (/jsp/signup.jsp).
Fill out the form with a username and password. This will create an Employee account by default.
2. Login:
Navigate to the Login Page (/jsp/login.jsp).
Enter your credentials. The system will redirect you based on your role:
Employees can request access to software.
Managers can view and approve/reject requests.
Admins can manage software and access requests.
3. Request Software Access:
As an Employee, go to the Request Access Page (/jsp/requestAccess.jsp), choose a software, specify the access level, and submit a request.
4. Approve or Reject Requests:
As a Manager, go to the Pending Requests Page (/jsp/pendingRequests.jsp) and review the requests.
Approve or reject requests, which will update their status.
5. Add New Software:
As an Admin, go to the Create Software Page (/jsp/createSoftware.jsp) and add new software with specified access levels.
Evaluate Rule
The evaluation criteria for this project are based on the following:

Basic Functionality: The system must support user registration, login, software creation (Admin), and access requests (Employee).
Role-Based Access: Users should have access to specific features based on their role.
Database Interaction: Ensure the system correctly interacts with the PostgreSQL database, including user registration, request submissions, and approval statuses.
Error Handling: Proper handling of invalid input and database errors.
Security: Passwords should be securely stored, and role-based access control should be enforced.
Testing
Unit Testing:

Write unit tests for your servlets to validate business logic.
Use tools like JUnit for testing your Java methods.
Integration Testing:

Test the integration between the servlets, JSP, and PostgreSQL.
Test various workflows, such as user registration, request submission, and approval.
Manual Testing:

Manually test the application in the browser by registering users, submitting requests, and approving/rejecting them.
Test Cases:

Test for invalid logins, duplicate registrations, unauthorized access, and invalid data submission.
